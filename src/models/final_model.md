Unfortunately, the trained model (h5 file) is too large for GitHub.

To replicate either:

* Email me at kkiefer@umich.edu. I am happy to send you the file.
* Run `cnn_aws.py`. This will require gaining access to the raw data and using all my preprocessing scripts. Unfortunately, I cannot share the data. If interested in further development, you must request access [here](http://dcapswoz.ict.usc.edu/).
